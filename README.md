# The Tax Fraud Guy's (bash) dotfiles
This borrows heavily from [caarlos0's old dotfiles](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles). All credit to him.

## Installing
There are some hardcodes in here, unfortunately, so check out this repo to `~/.dotfiles` and, from repo root, run `./bootstrap.sh`

## Bash? Srsly?
Yes, srsly. These are the dotfiles for when I'm using bash. Which is more often than you'd think.
